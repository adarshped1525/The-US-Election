üèõÔ∏è The Oval Office: Predicting the 47th U.S. President

A machine learning project aimed at forecasting the outcome of the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election using demographic, socioeconomic, and polling data. The model assists campaigners, policymakers, and researchers in understanding electoral trends and making data-driven decisions.
# Introduction

This project simulates the prediction of the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election outcome between candidates using a machine learning-based approach.
Objective:

    To develop a robust machine learning model that predicts the winning party based on real-world data.

    Analyze features like census statistics, employment, education, age, and polling trends.

# Data Collection
Sources:

    United States Census Bureau: demographics, age, employment, education

    FiveThirtyEight: polling predictions, historical election data

Preprocessing Tasks:

    Data cleaning and transformation

    Feature selection and engineering

    Handling missing or inconsistent data

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key Findings:

    States with higher education levels and diversity lean towards the Democratic Party

    Higher-income households tend to support the Republican Party

    Swing states: Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania exhibited the most variability

    Middle-income voters leaned Democratic

# Modeling and Evaluation
Models Used:

    Random Forest

    XGBoost

    Ensemble Model (Best performer)

Performance Metrics:

    Accuracy: 0.90

    F1 Score: 0.89

Model Testing:

    Latency for training: 0.1269 seconds
